A simple mp4 file analyzer.
The plan is that it should be able to:
- show Atom/Box structure of the file
  - Target is to have GUI and not only text based
  - show understandable info about the atom as well as raw data (hex/ascii combo)
- show info about the media streams (codec info)
- calculate audio/video interleave depth (possibly displaying as a graph)
- Display meta data (artist, title, ...)
